# Subgroup analysis in linear model with measurement error

This is the official implementation of "Subgroup analysis in linear model with measurement error" in Canadian Journal of Statistics.

## `sgaeiv` package overview

- `iteration_procedures.R`: the proposed algorithm in this paper.

- `iteration_ma.R`: the algorithm in ''Exploration of Heterogeneous Treatment Effects via Concave Fusion (Ma et al., 2020)" .

- `UpdateDelta.R`: functions used in the ADMM algorithm to update the parameter $\boldsymbol{\delta}$, which can be applied to both *SCAD* and *MCP* penalty functions.
